Quizzes
-------

Each of the questions asks you to explain an author's _argument_ for a given claim. To answer the question, you will need to reconstruct the author's argument and provide a clear statement of it, in your own words, step by step. Why, exactly, does the author think what he thinks? Note that you are _not_ asked to evaluate the argument, but merely to identify and clearly reproduce the argument in your own words.

The purpose of the quizzes is to give you a chance to demonstrate that you understand the arguments we are studying, and to help you prepare for writing your papers, in which you will be critically evaluating arguments and making arguments of your own. For each quiz, you must submit a response of no more than 1â€“2 (double-spaced) pages.
